# ðŸ¤– SAUTE - Feature Selection Algorithm for Partial Label Learning ðŸ¤–

## About the Project

This package implements the SAUTE variable selection algorithm for the Partial Label Learning problem, as presented in the paper *Submodular Feature Selection for Partial Label Learning (2022) W. Bao, J, Hang, M. Zhang*, along with modifications proposed in my Bachelor's thesis (available in the `docs/` directory; note that the thesis is only available in Polish).  

Additionally, the package includes two popular classification algorithms for Partial Label Learning: **PL-KNN** and **IPAL**.  

The package provides a fully functional tool for engineers and researchers who want to apply machine learning algorithms to Partial Label data.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub repository using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/PiotrDS/SAUTE-feature-selection.git
```

## Examples

Example usage can be found in the guide located in the vignettes directory.
